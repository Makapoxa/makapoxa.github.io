Today i finally came to play skirmish basketball games. I'm going to be in second university team at ASB games. But it isn't the point of this post.\\
The point is, if you are strongly confident in something, you can achieve the highest heights. I shot many balls today only because i was confident. I trusted myself, my body, my hands. Even if i missed a wide open shot, i didn't lose confidence. I shot again and again, so i outplayed many of my buddies.\\
You can say it was luck i didn't miss much today. I'm saying it was confidence.\\
Ofcourse it is just another silly example, but be confident in youself, so you will achieve anything you want.\\
Sincerely yours, Dmitry.
