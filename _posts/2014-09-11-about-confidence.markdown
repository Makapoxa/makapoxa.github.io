“Deron Williams went like 0-for-9,” Chopra began telling SI.
“I was like, ‘Can you believe Deron Williams went 0-9?’ Kobe was like,
‘I would go 0-30 before I would go 0-9.  0-9 means you beat yourself,
you psyched yourself out of the game, because Deron Williams can get more shots in the game.
The only reason is because you’ve just now lost confidence in yourself.’” \\
The moral of the story — keep shooting. You can’t make your next big shot without an attempt.\\
\\
Try to keep up.
