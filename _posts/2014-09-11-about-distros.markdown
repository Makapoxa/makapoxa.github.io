My first distro was Ubuntu linux 10.04. Now i still use Ubuntu, it fits me. I don't need to clean it up sometimes like windows,
i configurated it just once and now i'm using it.  \\
I tried Arch, Debian, Fedora, many of their children (Crunchbang, chakra, bodhi etc.), but they are not that good. They need more time to cook them, and i'm hungry. \\
Sometimes it's fun, to make experiments, to cook, to enjoy it, but this excitement fades in time.

When i chose distro, i experimented with desktop environments. But finally the best for me still is unity. KDE is good, but i think i have first love syndrome, so i still use unity.
