I always was interested in obtaining new knowledge, it was very exciting exprerience for me to experience (pardon the pun) something new.
Once i became UlSTU student, i finally installed my first linux distro. It was ubuntu 10.04. I heard nothing about it, except small phrases or words, such as 'synaptic' or 'apt', but i didn't understand meaning of them.
I used it for netbook Samsung N152, it worked perfectly, much faster than stock Windows 7 Starter, so i liked it. Later on, i read getting started about arch, i liked it, i understood many things such as [X][x.org], [bash][bash] etc.
Later i learned about [zsh][zsh], i started using it, i learned about zsh-syntax-highlighting etc.
I tried many distros, but the most acceptable to me are Arch-linux and Ubuntu.
Sincerely yours, Dmitry.
